# ASC-CLD-LA-Dashboard
This repository contains the code used to produce the data tables underpinning the DHSC Client Level Data Dashboard for Local Authorities.

Local Authorities submit Client Level Data to NHS England each quarter. NHS England pseudonymise the data to remove identifying personal information, and provide DHSC access to the pseudonymised national dataset, including submission meta data and a number of additional, derived fields, via a secure database. The scripts in this repository analyse this national dataset.

The scripts are numbered and run sequentially. The scripts occasionally execute stored procedures which are currently not publicly available, however we intend to share these in due course.

This git repository does not allow contributors and is solely for the purpose of sharing the code used to produce the CLD dashboard with Local Authority analysts.

More information on how DHSC intends to use Client Level Data can be found in the transparency statement: https://www.ardengemcsu.nhs.uk/media/3589/dhsc-cld-transparency-statement.pdf
